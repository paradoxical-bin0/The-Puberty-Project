          <h1>LGBTQ</h1>
          <p style="font-weight: 700">
            LGBTQ = Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer or Questioning
            persons or the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Equality and freedom from discrimination are fundamental human
            rights that belong to all people, regardless of sexual orientation,
            gender identity or because they are intersex.
          </p>
          <h2>LESBIAN</h2>
          <p>
            A woman whose enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional
            attraction is to other women. Some lesbians may prefer to identify
            as gay or as gay women.
          </p>
          <h2>GAY</h2>
          <p>
            The adjective describes people whose enduring physical, romantic,
            and/or emotional attractions are to people of the same sex.
            Sometimes lesbian is the preferred term for women.
          </p>

          <h2>BISEXUAL</h2>
          <p>
            A person who can form enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional
            attractions to those of the same gender or more than one gender.
            People may experience this attraction in differing ways and degrees
            over their lifetime. Bisexual people need not have had specific
            sexual experiences to be bisexual; they need not have had any sexual
            experience at all to identify as bisexual.
          </p>
          <h2>TRANSGENDER</h2>
          <p>
            An umbrella term for people whose gender identity and/or gender
            expression differs from what is typically associated with the sex
            they were assigned at birth. People under the transgender umbrella
            may describe themselves using one or more of a wide variety of
            terms— including transgender or nonbinary. Some transgender people
            are prescribed hormones by their doctors to bring their bodies into
            alignment with their gender identity. Some undergo surgery as well.
            But not all transgender people can or will take those steps, and a
            transgender identity is not dependent upon physical appearance or
            medical procedures.
          </p>
          <h2>QUEER</h2>
          <p>
            An adjective used by some people whose sexual orientation is not
            exclusively heterosexual or straight. This umbrella term includes
            people who have nonbinary, gender-fluid, or gender nonconforming
            identities. Once considered a pejorative term, queer has been
            reclaimed by some LGBTQIA+ people to describe themselves; however,
            it is not a universally accepted term even within the LGBTQIA+
            community.
          </p>
          <h1>QUESTIONING</h1>
          <p>
            Sometimes, when the Q is seen at the end of LGBT, it can also mean
            questioning. This term describes someone who is questioning their
            sexual orientation or gender identity.
          </p>
          <h1>INTERSEX</h1>
          <p>
            An adjective used to describe a person with one or more innate sex
            characteristics, including genitals, internal reproductive organs,
            and chromosomes, that fall outside of traditional conceptions of
            male or female bodies. Do not confuse having an intersex trait with
            being transgender. Intersex people are assigned a sex at birth —
            either male or female — and that decision by medical providers and
            parents may not match the gender identity of the child. Not all
            intersex folks identify as being part of the LGBTQIA+ community.
          </p>
          <h1>ASEXUAL</h1>
          <p>
            The adjective describes a person who does not experience sexual
            attraction. Sometimes shortened to “ace,” it is an umbrella term
            that can also include people who are demisexual, meaning they do
            experience some sexual attraction; graysexual, meaning those who may
            not fit the strictest definition of the word asexual; and aromantic,
            meaning they experience little to no romantic attraction and/or has
            little to no desire to form romantic relationships.
          </p>
          <h1>+ PLUS</h1>
          <p>
            The ‘plus’ is used to signify all of the gender identities and
            sexual orientations that letters and words cannot yet fully
            describe.

              families report feeling happier than those who aren’t.
            </li>
            <li>
              While non-LGBT students struggle most with school classes, exams,
              and work, their LGBT peers say the biggest problem they face is
              unaccepting families.

            LGBTQ+ Pride Flags and What They Stand For :
          </h2>
          <h3>Gilbert Baker Pride Flag</h3>
          <p>Gilbert Pride Flag , the flag that started it all…</p>
          <p>
            It was created in 1977 by Gilbert Baker, an artist, activist, and
            openly gay military veteran. Tasked by Harvey Milk, a historic
            figure in the fight for LGBTQ rights, to create a flag for the queer
            community, Baker created a rainbow flag with eight different colors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspired by the classic song "Over the Rainbow" from the 1939 film
            The Wizard from Oz, Baker created a rainbow flag to represent LGBTQ
            folks. Each color in the flag also had a specific meaning.
          </p>
          <p>Hot Pink symbolizes sex</p>
          <p>Red equals life</p>
          <p>Orange symbolizes healing</p>
          <p>Yellow stands for sunlight</p>
          <p>Green represents nature|</p>
          <p>Turquoise equals magic & art</p>
          <p>Indigo stands for serenity</p>
          <p>Violet represents the spirit of LGBTQ people</p>
