          <h1>Mental Health & Adolescence</h1>
          <p>
            One in six people are aged 10-19 years. Adolescence is a unique and
            formative time. Physical, emotional and social changes, including
            exposure to poverty, abuse, or violence, can make adolescents
            vulnerable to mental health problems. Protecting adolescents from
            adversity, promoting socio-emotional learning and psychological
            well-being, and ensuring access to mental health care are critical
            for their health and well-being during adolescence and adulthood.
            Globally, it is estimated that 1 in 7 (14%) 10-19 year-olds
            experience mental health conditions(1), yet these remain largely
            unrecognized and untreated. Adolescents with mental health
            conditions are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion,
            discrimination, stigma (affecting readiness to seek help),
            educational difficulties, risk-taking behaviours, physical
            ill-health and human rights violations.
          </p>

          <h1>Mental health determinants</h1>
          <p>
            Adolescence is a crucial period for developing social and emotional
            habits important for mental well-being. These include adopting
            healthy sleep patterns; exercising regularly; developing coping,
            problem-solving, and interpersonal skills; and learning to manage
            emotions. Protective and supportive environments in the family, at
            school and in the wider community are important. Multiple factors
            affect mental health. The more risk factors adolescents are exposed
            to, the greater the potential impact on their mental health. Factors
            that can contribute to stress during adolescence include exposure to
            adversity, pressure to conform with peers and exploration of
            identity. Media influence and gender norms can exacerbate the
            disparity between an adolescent’s lived reality and their
            perceptions or aspirations for the future. Other important
            determinants include the quality of their home life and
            relationships with peers. Violence (especially sexual violence and
            bullying), harsh parenting and severe and socioeconomic problems are
            recognized risks to mental health. Some adolescents are at greater
            risk of mental health conditions due to their living conditions,
            stigma, discrimination or exclusion, or lack of access to quality
            support and services. These include adolescents living in
            humanitarian and fragile settings; adolescents with chronic illness,
            autism spectrum disorder, an intellectual disability or other
            neurological condition; pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents, or
            those in early or forced marriages; orphans; and adolescents from
            minority ethnic or sexual backgrounds or other discriminated groups.
          </p>
          <h1>Emotional disorders</h1>
          <p>
            Emotional disorders are common among adolescents. Anxiety disorders
            (which may involve panic or excessive worry) are the most prevalent
            in this age group and are more common among older than among younger
            adolescents. It is estimated that 3.6% of 10-14 year-olds and 4.6%
            of 15-19 year-olds experience an anxiety disorder. Depression is
            estimated to occur among 1.1% of adolescents aged 10-14 years, and
            2.8% of 15-19-year-olds. Depression and anxiety share some of the
            same symptoms, including rapid and unexpected changes in mood.
            Anxiety and depressive disorders can profoundly affect school
            attendance and schoolwork. Social withdrawal can exacerbate
            isolation and loneliness. Depression can lead to suicide.
          </p>

          <h1>Behavioural disorders</h1>
          <p>
            Behavioural disorders are more common among younger adolescents than
            older adolescents. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
            characterized by difficulty paying attention, excessive activity and
            acting without regard to consequences, occurs among 3.1% of 10-14
            year-olds and 2.4% of 15-19 year-olds(1). Conduct disorder
            (involving symptoms of destructive or challenging behaviour) occurs
            among 3.6% of 10-14 year-olds and 2.4% of 15-19 year-olds(1).
            Behavioural disorders can affect adolescents’ education and conduct
            disorder may result in criminal behaviour.
          </p>

          <h1>Eating disorders</h1>
          <p>
            Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa,
            commonly emerge during adolescence and young adulthood. Eating
            disorders involve abnormal eating behaviour and preoccupation with
            food, accompanied in most instances by concerns about body weight
            and shape. Anorexia nervosa can lead to premature death, often due
            to medical complications or suicide, and has higher mortality than
            any other mental disorder.
          </p>

          <h1>Psychosis</h1>
          <p>
            Conditions that include symptoms of psychosis most commonly emerge
            in late adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms can include
            hallucinations or delusions. These experiences can impair an
            adolescent’s ability to participate in daily life and education and
            often lead to stigma or human rights violations.
          </p>

          <h1>Suicide and self-harm</h1>
          <p>
            Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in older adolescents
            (15-19 years)(2). Risk factors for suicide are multifaceted, and
            include harmful use of alcohol, abuse in childhood, stigma against
            help-seeking, barriers to accessing care and access to means of
            suicide. Digital media, like any other media, can play a significant
            role in either enhancing or weakening suicide prevention efforts.
          </p>

          <h1>Risk-taking behaviours</h1>
          <p>
            Many risk-taking behaviours for health, such as substance use or
            sexual risk-taking, start during adolescence. Risk-taking behaviours
            can be an unhelpful strategy to cope with emotional difficulties and
            can severely impact an adolescent’s mental and physical well-being.
            Worldwide, the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking among
            adolescents aged 15­-19 years was 13.6% in 2016, with males most at
            risk(3). The use of tobacco and cannabis are additional concerns.
            Many adult smokers had their first cigarette prior to the age of 18
            years. Cannabis is the most widely used drug among young people with
            about 4.7% of 15-16 years-olds using it at least once in 2018(4).
            Perpetration of violence is a risk-taking behaviour that can
            increase the likelihood of low educational attainment, injury,
            involvement with crime or death. Interpersonal violence was ranked
            among the leading causes of death of older adolescent boys in
            2019(5).
          </p>

          <h1>Promotion and prevention</h1>
          <p>
            Mental health promotion and prevention interventions aim to
            strengthen an individual's capacity to regulate emotions, enhance
            alternatives to risk-taking behaviours, build resilience for
            managing difficult situations and adversity, and promote supportive
            social environments and social networks. These programmes require a
            multi-level approach with varied delivery platforms – for example,
            digital media, health or social care settings, schools or the
            community – and varied strategies to reach adolescents, particularly
            the most vulnerable.
          </p>

          <h1>Early detection and treatment</h1>
          <p>
            It is crucial to address the needs of adolescents with mental health
            conditions. Avoiding institutionalization and over-medicalization,
            prioritizing non-pharmacological approaches, and respecting the
            rights of children in line with the United Nations Convention on the
            Rights of the Child and other human rights instruments are key for
            adolescents’ mental health.
